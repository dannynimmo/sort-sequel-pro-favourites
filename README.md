# Sort Sequel Pro Favourites

I have many saved favourites in my Sequel Pro, and I needed a way to sort these alphabetically.

## Usage

Run from the command line, passing in the path to your favourites file (on MacOS the default location is `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sequel\ Pro/Data/Favorites.plist`):
```bash
sort-sequel-pro-favourites.phar --file /path/to/Favorites.plist
```
